Launched on May 10th, 2014, VeriCoin is a pure digital currency that runs on its own unique protocol known as Proof of Stake Time (PoST). PoST features variable interest rates based on total number of coins staked network-wide, while considering the overall duration that individual wallets have staked. The longer that users stake personal wallets the more interest is generated while simultaneously increasing network security.
